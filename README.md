# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Multi-User Data (Custom Additions)

The backend has been adapted for per-user data isolation:

* Every category and recipe now has a `userId` (taken from the JWT `sub`).
* All `/api/categories`, `/api/recipes/:categoryId`, upload, update, and delete routes require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header and only operate on the authenticated user's data.
* Registration (`POST /api/auth/register`) now returns a token so the client can auto-login.

### Migrating Existing Data

If you had existing `categories.json` / `recipes.json` without `userId`, run the migration assigning them to a chosen user (e.g., the first created admin user):

```bash
cd recipe-api
# Replace with a real existing user _id from users.json (create one via register if needed)
JWT_USER_ID=<userId> node migrate-add-userId.js
```

After this, restart the server. Old items will appear only for that user.

### Adding a New User

1. Call `POST /api/auth/register` with `{ "username": "name", "password": "pass" }`.
2. Use returned token for subsequent API calls.

### Frontend Behavior

* Login page lets you toggle between login and registration.
* Each logged-in user sees only their own categories and recipes.
* Upload form lists only the user's categories.

### Notes

This is a lightweight file-based implementation. For production, consider migrating to a database (e.g., MongoDB) and enforcing unique indices plus stronger validation.
